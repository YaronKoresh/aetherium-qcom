## About the Project:

* The project was created by [Yaron Koresh](mailto:aharonkoresh1@gmail.com).
* This project is licensed under the MIT open-source license.

---

## What it does?

* **Establishes a Secure Key** using a unique, multi-layered protocol inspired by quantum mechanics, defended by a Bayesian AI that intelligently detects anomalies.
* **Enables Live, Secure Chat** between two users with end-to-end encryption powered by a chaotic stream cipher.
* **Provides a Full Cryptography Suite** for offline use, including high-speed encryption/decryption and one-way hashing, all derived from the quantum-generated key.
* **Hides Data in Any File** using a versatile and secure steganography tool that requires a unique, single-use key for extraction.

## Basic Installation:

* The platform will automatically check for and install required Python packages (like `numpy`) on the first run.

---

## Basic Usage:

Aetherium Q-Com is a live platform that requires at least two users (and one relay) to function.

1.  **Launch the Relay Node:** One user must run the platform and select the **"Launch Relay (Charlie)"** role. This machine will act as the central, untrusted relay.
2.  **Launch the Client Nodes:** You and a partner launch the platform on your respective machines, selecting either the **"Alice"** or **"Bob"** role.
    * Enter the IP address of the user running the Relay Node.
    * Enter your partner's IP address for the direct chat connection.
    * Click **"Launch & Connect"**.
3.  **Establish Secure Key:** The platform will automatically perform the quantum key exchange protocol. The AI will monitor the channel for security.
4.  **Communicate and Create:** Once the key is securely established, the "Secure Chat", "Cryptography Tools", and "Steganography Tools" tabs will be unlocked for use.
